                        Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally
                        admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of
                        Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million
                        visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World
                        (2000–2007) initiative. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but
                        work continued on other
                        phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
                        completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million
                        rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million).</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 60px;">Petra is a historical and archaeological city in
                        southern Jordan. Petra
                        lies around Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of
                        the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has
                        been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would
                        become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. However,
                        archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second
                        century BC,[8] by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic
                        Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major
                        regional trading hub.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 60px;">Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel,
                        located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.
                        Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor
                        Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the
                        most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it
                        a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to
                        the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American
                        historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.

                        Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul
                        Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French
                        engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed
                        between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft)
                        pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.

                        The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the
                        700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city
                        of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a
                        cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the
                        World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.</p>

                        series of
                        fortification systems generally built across the historical northern borders of China to protect
                        and consolidate territories of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic groups of the
                        steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by
                        ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang
                        (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.Later on, many
                        successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most
                        well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-top: 60px;">Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city
                        built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. Chichen Itza was a major focal point in
                        the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD
                        600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the
                        Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles,
                        reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern
                        Maya lowlands. Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been
                        one of the
                        mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may
                        have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to
                        the variety of architectural styles at the site.

                        of the
                        city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced
                        concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000
                        spectators. The Colosseum is just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor
                        Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further
                        modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known
                        as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their
                        family name (Flavius).
